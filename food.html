        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Carbohydrates</dt>
            <dd>Carbohydrates are energy-giving food. During respiration, carbohydrates are oxidized to give energy and heat. The energy is used for work.</dd>

            <h2>Proteins</h2>
            <p>Proteins are body-building foods. They are needed in the body for building new cells, repairing damaged tissues, and for growth. When protein is not adequate in our body, it may result in poor health in an adult and if the person is a child, it may lead to stunted growth, weak muscles, swollen legs, protruded stomach, and change of hair color.</p>

            <dd>Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting immune function, and are found in foods like meat, fish, eggs, and legumes.</dd>

        <dl>
            <dt>Fats</dt>
            <dd>Fats supply long-lasting energy, support cell function, and help absorb vitamins, with sources including oils, butter, and avocados.</dd>
